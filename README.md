## Overview
 
In preparation of your upcoming web project, the deliverable for this assignment is a simple information architecture for the website you plan to build. If you already have a website, this is an invitation/exercise in cataloguing the way everything is already built, revealing opportunities for
clearing up the order of your site or completely re-imagining it.

### Requirements

#### Site goals

Define your site's goal(s). You may have one or multiple; write these at the top of your site map document. These may be along the lines of:

On a piece of paper or in a blank digital document, list all of the content that you expect to display on your site. Examples include (but are not limited to):

* Biography paragraph(s)
* List(s) of skills
* List(s) of appropriate projects
* Social media links
* Professional documents
* Media (videos)
* Related descriptive text content

#### Content

* Attempt to group your content into categories. These may reflect either the pages (if you plan to have a multiple page site) or sections (if you're interested in a single-page or "parallax" design).
* If you're planning to include media of any kind, what functional support will these features need? Make a note next to any features that may require site structure beyond simply pictures and text.
* Draw your content organization and hierarchy using a tool of your choice, dividing content into pages or sections where that content is likely to appear. List the content you expect to add to these pages or sections beside or below the section or page names.

### Deliverable

A single document in the `writing` directory (in a format of your choice) which clearly incorporates and defines:

* All content you plan to include on your site
* Considers at least three levels of architecture: the main entry point/page, individual sections/pages, content contained therein
* Pages or sections expected
* Content planned for each page

### Grading criteria

Like many assignments in this course, assessment of this work is based on completeness. I may indicate that you should revise this assignment which is an opporunity to receive full credit for the assignment should there be missing points or content.
